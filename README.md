# Scheduling_Algorithms

A Streamlit-based interactive web app that visualizes how different CPU Scheduling Algorithms (SJF, FCFS, Priority, and Round Robin) work in real time.
Users can enter custom process data or use predefined examples to simulate scheduling, view Gantt charts, and analyze Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time for each process.

Built with Python, Streamlit, and PIL, this project provides an easy and visual way to understand process scheduling concepts used in operating systems.
